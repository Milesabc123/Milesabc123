ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Milesabc123
- Iâ€™m interested in learning and writing python programmes.   
- Iâ€™m currently building many different types of programmes including building some APIs to discogs, IMDB, news sites and twitter. Iâ€™ve written a python programme to manage my vinyl collection and Iâ€™ve linked to discogs to pull in the track names via their API. It was good fun! 
- As I work in financial services I am also looking into ISO20022 and of course ISO 8583 (I know it well from companies Iâ€™ve worked at). So I built a python programme to act as an â€˜example bankâ€™. So the programme creates a few customer accounts with random balances, reads in some payment instruction data in XML format, does a funds check against the accounts and also a pretend sanctions check against a made-up sanctions list. Any payments that donâ€™t fail these tests are converted into ISO 8583 (to simulate an outward FPS payment) and the accounts are debited. Any Payments that fail are reported to operational repair queue.      
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some projects mainly to learn how to code collaboratively
